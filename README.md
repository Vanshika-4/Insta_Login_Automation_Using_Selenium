At first step we need Download Selenium 
```
pip install selenium

Then Download Driver, as for me I am using Chrome Browser so I downloaded chromedriver as per my Chrome Version. Then copy the path in the Edit environment Variables.

Go for stable version and download it according to your OS. As for mine it is Windows 64.
